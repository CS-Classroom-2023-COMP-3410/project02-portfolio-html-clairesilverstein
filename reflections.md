The main issue I faced working on this project was getting things to look how I wanted using just HTML. I know that was kind of the point of the project but it was still more challenging than I expected. It was a cool experiment to see how far I could go with just HTML. One thing I had to change was using unordered lists didn't allow the bullet points to be centered so I used tables instead. I also used tables to put images on the same rows as eachother. When I first began the website, I was going to just make it music themed but I realized I can make it even more unique so I changed it to be more about the Chicago music scene. This is because the Chicago music scene truly shaped me as a musician. I feel like that helped make my website more unique.
